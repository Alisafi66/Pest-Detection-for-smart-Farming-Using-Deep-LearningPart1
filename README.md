# Pest Detection for Smart Farming Using Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of my Final Year Project (FYP) titled **"Pest Detection for Smart Farming Using Deep Learning"** at Multimedia University, Malaysia.

The project explores the use of **zero-shot object detection** using two AI models:
- **Grounding DINO (Model 1)**
- **AIM-V2 (Model 2)**

The objective is to identify pests from images with high accuracy and recommend the most suitable model based on evaluation and expert farmer feedback.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Apply zero-shot object detection for pest detection.
- Compare AIM-V2 and Grounding DINO performance.
- Evaluate results using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Discuss findings with expert farmers to determine the best detection model.

## 🚀 Models Used

### 🔹 Grounding DINO
- Works without predefined classes.
- Generates bounding boxes based on natural language prompts.
- Showed strong performance in identifying insects with ~82% accuracy.

### 🔹 AIM-V2
- AI model fine-tuned for visual comprehension tasks.
- Provided higher accuracy for certain pest classes.
